# Alpha Shapes SOP
Use Alpha Shapes algorithm calculation for input SOP points and output resulting mesh with triangle faces. Using CGAL, Computational Geometry Algorithms Library, https://www.cgal.org. To be able to build this sop you have to install CGAL library. The easiest way is to use [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/), more info on [CGAL installation manual](https://doc.cgal.org/latest/Manual/windows.html).

## Parameters
* **Use optimal Alpha** - Use optimal Alpha value that is automatically calculated.
* **Alpha** - Set manual alpha (Î±) value for calculation.
